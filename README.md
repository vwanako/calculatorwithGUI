# calculatorwithGUI
This project was my first ever C++ project with a GUI. It uses the .NET framework in Visual Studio to create a functioning calculator. I made this following this <a href="https://youtu.be/_yHqktG2GU4" target="_blank">youtube tutorial by Paul Oamen</a>.

I also added some extra functionalities and changed the appeareance of the program to make it more aesthetically pleasing.
